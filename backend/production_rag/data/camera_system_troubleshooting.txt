CAMERA & IMAGING SYSTEM TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE
PAINT DEFECT DETECTION MACHINE

======================================
PROBLEM: PHOTOS NOT CORRECTLY SATURATED / LOW SATURATION
Possible Causes:
- Insufficient light intensity from LED system
- Camera exposure settings too low
- White balance misconfiguration
- Lens aperture too small

Solution:
1. Increase LED lighting intensity by 15-20% in control panel.
2. Adjust camera exposure compensation to +0.5 to +1.0 EV.
3. Recalibrate white balance for current lighting conditions.
4. Check lens aperture setting - increase to f/2.8 or wider if possible.
5. Verify LED lights are functioning properly (no burnt-out LEDs).

Expected Outcome: Photos will show proper color saturation with accurate defect visibility.

======================================
PROBLEM: OVERSATURATED IMAGES / TOO BRIGHT
Possible Causes:
- Excessive LED lighting intensity
- Camera exposure too high
- Incorrect ISO settings

Solution:
1. Reduce LED lighting intensity by 10-15%.
2. Lower camera exposure compensation to -0.5 EV.
3. Set camera ISO to AUTO or reduce to 100-200.
4. Enable auto-exposure if available.

Expected Outcome: Balanced exposure with natural color representation.

======================================
PROBLEM: DARK OR UNDEREXPOSED IMAGES
Possible Causes:
- Low light intensity
- Fast shutter speed
- Dirty camera lens or LED covers
- Power supply issues to lighting system

Solution:
1. Increase LED brightness to maximum safe level.
2. Slow down shutter speed (increase exposure time).
3. Clean camera lens and LED light covers with microfiber cloth.
4. Check power supply voltage to LED system (should be 24V DC).
5. Replace any faulty LED modules.

Expected Outcome: Clear, well-lit images suitable for defect detection.

======================================
PROBLEM: BLURRY OR OUT-OF-FOCUS IMAGES
Possible Causes:
- Camera focus not calibrated
- Conveyor speed too fast for shutter speed
- Vibration in mounting system
- Dirty lens

Solution:
1. Run auto-focus calibration routine from control panel.
2. Reduce conveyor speed to 0.5-0.8 m/s.
3. Increase shutter speed to 1/500s or faster.
4. Check and tighten camera mounting bolts.
5. Clean lens thoroughly.

Expected Outcome: Sharp, clear images with visible defect details.

======================================
PROBLEM: UNEVEN LIGHTING IN PHOTOS
Possible Causes:
- LED lights positioned incorrectly
- Some LED modules failed
- Reflective surfaces causing hotspots

Solution:
1. Reposition LED light bars for even coverage (45-degree angle recommended).
2. Test each LED module individually and replace faulty ones.
3. Use diffuser panels to soften light.
4. Adjust light distance from inspection area (optimal: 30-40cm).

Expected Outcome: Uniform lighting across entire inspection area.

======================================
PROBLEM: COLOR CAST IN IMAGES (YELLOW/BLUE TINT)
Possible Causes:
- Incorrect white balance setting
- LED color temperature mismatch
- Aging LED lights

Solution:
1. Perform manual white balance calibration using gray card.
2. Set white balance to match LED color temperature (typically 5000-6500K).
3. Replace aging LED modules if color temperature has shifted.
4. Enable automatic white balance if manual adjustment fails.

Expected Outcome: Neutral color representation without color cast.

======================================
PROBLEM: CAMERA NOT CAPTURING IMAGES
Possible Causes:
- Camera power supply disconnected
- Communication cable loose
- Camera firmware error
- Trigger signal not received

Solution:
1. Check camera power cable connection (ensure 12V DC supply).
2. Verify USB/Ethernet cable is securely connected.
3. Restart camera module from control panel.
4. Check trigger sensor on conveyor belt.
5. Update camera firmware if necessary.

Expected Outcome: Camera captures images at proper intervals.
